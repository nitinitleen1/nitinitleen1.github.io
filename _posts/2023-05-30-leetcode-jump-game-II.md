# Solving LeetCode Problem: Jump Game II

## Introduction

In this blog post, we'll explore a solution to the LeetCode problem "Jump Game II." This problem involves finding the minimum number of jumps required to reach the end of an array, where each element represents the maximum distance that can be jumped from that position.

## Problem Statement

Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index. Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position. Determine the minimum number of jumps to reach the last index.

## Solution Approach

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm approach. We start from the first index and keep track of the current furthest reach and the maximum reach we can achieve in one jump. As we iterate through the array, if we reach the current maximum reach, we increment the jump count and update the maximum reach to the next furthest position. By doing this, we ensure that we are always making the optimal choice to reach the end with the minimum number of jumps.

## Algorithm Steps

1. Initialize variables:
   - `maxReach`: maximum reach possible in one jump from the current position.
   - `furthest`: the furthest position we can reach with the minimum number of jumps.
   - `jumps`: the count of jumps taken so far.
2. Iterate through the array from index 0 to `n-1`:
   - If the current index is greater than or equal to `furthest`, we need to take a jump. Increment `jumps` and update `furthest` to `maxReach`.
   - Update `maxReach` by taking the maximum of the current `maxReach` and `nums[i] + i`.
3. Return the value of `jumps`.

## Python Implementation

```python
def jump(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    if n == 1:
        return 0

    maxReach = nums[0]
    furthest = nums[0]
    jumps = 1

    for i in range(1, n):
        if i > furthest:
            jumps += 1
            furthest = maxReach
        maxReach = max(maxReach, nums[i] + i)

    return jumps
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we discussed the LeetCode problem "Jump Game II" and provided a Python solution that uses a greedy algorithm approach. By updating the maxReach and furthest variables, we can efficiently find the minimum number of jumps required to reach the end of the array. This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array. Feel free to try out the solution on LeetCode and explore further optimizations if desired.
